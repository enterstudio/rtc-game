# Webrtc game ideas

* Grid of puzzles for home base
* Upgrades
  - defensive (puzzles, walls, notifications for when you're away)
  - offensive (stealth, better puzzle cracking)
* While you're "home" you can buy upgrades, see what's going on
* Connect through other nodes "hops" (if a node drops, you snap back to the last available host?)
  - penalty for disconnecting?
* Prize for getting to the "core";
  - gain xp/knowledge points
  - gain access to their peers
* Viruses
  - plant viruses
  - detect viruses in your home server (virus scan, antivirus)
* Using abilities costs "cycles"?
  - categories of abilities (offense, defense, etc?)
* "Marketplace" for user-generated content?
* Teams
  - individual to start
  - customizable insignia
  - join teams by earning their trust
  - bigger teams have more power but more to lose, better loot, easier to detect etc
  - how to discover? (Neutral peers?)
* Persistence degrades over time if you don't come back
  - traps might degrade
  - etc
* "Neutral" peers that are always online
* Save games
  - local master, server backup
  - Blockchain w/neutral(nullsec) servers as dominant miners

# Notes from Garaje

* So you have to connect to a peer, hop through nodes, and then drop something on to someone else's node.
  - Kind of like a big capture the flag game.
* You as a user would see a list of random peers (let's say 3) with some information about them, like maybe a user name and a geolocation and something fun like their hacker level.
* You connect to a single peer, and then what happens?
* The goal would be something like a capture the flag like thing. Every one is an enemy, or maybe there are teams.
* Green, hacker-style map.
* You go to a peer and you get a list of peers that they're aware of and can then connect to them.
* You build a big graph of peers that you are aware of.
  - What if you had to "break into" a peer before you could get a list of their peers?
* The only reason why this is webrtc is that it's realtime and the person is online.
  - So they should have some way to set up defenses.
