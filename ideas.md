# Webrtc game ideas

* Grid of puzzles for home base
* Upgrades
  - defensive (puzzles, walls, notifications for when you're away)
  - offensive (stealth, better puzzle cracking)
* While you're "home" you can buy upgrades, see what's going on
* Connect through other nodes "hops" (if a node drops, you snap back to the last available host?)
  - penalty for disconnecting?
* Prize for getting to the "core";
  - gain xp/knowledge points
  - gain access to their peers
* Viruses
  - plant viruses
  - detect viruses in your home server (virus scan, antivirus)
* Using abilities costs "cycles"?
  - categories of abilities (offense, defense, etc?)
* "Marketplace" for user-generated content?
* Teams
  - individual to start
  - customizable insignia
  - join teams by earning their trust
  - bigger teams have more power but more to lose, better loot, easier to detect etc
  - how to discover? (Neutral peers?)
* Persistence degrades over time if you don't come back
  - traps might degrade
  - etc
* "Neutral" peers that are always online
* Save games
  - local master, server backup
  - Blockchain w/neutral(nullsec) servers as dominant miners
